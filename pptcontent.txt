Team Name :
Problem Statement : Automated Test Case Generation with AI
Team Leader Name : Achyuth S S



Brief about our prototype - Genesis QA : AI - powered Healthcare test automation
An intelligent AI system that automatically converts healthcare software requirements into compliant, enterprise-ready test cases
Leverages Google's multimodal AI (Gemini Pro + Vision) to understand both text and visual requirements
Integrates seamlessly with existing ALM platforms (Jira, Azure DevOps, Polarion)
What problem do we solve?Healthcare QA teams normally spend 60% of their time manually converting regulatory documents following regulatory standards to test cases, thus taking away more time, slowing down critical software development lifecycles.
What our solution does?Genesis QA automates this entire process while ensuring full regulatory compliance and traceability - transforming weeks of manual work to minutes of AI-powered automation.


How different is Genesis QA from existing solutions in the market?

Traditional Solutions
Genesis QA
 Text-only processing
 Multimodal AI to process diagrams, flowcharts, UI mockups
 Generic test generation
 Healthcare-specific domain intelligence
 Compliance mapping performed manually
 Built-in regulatory knowledge is provided (FDA, HIPAA, IEC 62304)
 Standalone tools
 Enterprise ALM integration
 Limited traceability
 Complete audit trail automation

How do we solve existing problem?

We propose a multimodal method that involves parallel processing of textual & visual inputs / requirements leveraging different AI models for each
Our regulatory knowledge is fed with Healthcare Knowledge thus contains efficient mapping to FDA, HIPAA, IEC standards
We also incorporate edge case identification and generate test cases for all kinds of scenarios
In addition to this, we also have an Enterprise API layer thus enabling seamless bidirectional integration with ALM platforms and traceability links

USP of our proposed solution â€“
Healthcare-Native Compliance Engine in a Multimodal AI pipeline
