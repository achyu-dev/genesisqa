The cardiac monitoring device software must continuously monitor patient heart rate and detect arrhythmias within 5 seconds of occurrence. The system shall trigger audible and visual alarms when heart rate exceeds 120 BPM or falls below 50 BPM for adult patients. Medical staff should be able to configure alarm thresholds based on patient age and medical condition. The device must store at least 24 hours of continuous ECG data in its internal memory. The software shall automatically calibrate sensors every 30 minutes to ensure accurate readings. Healthcare providers must be able to view real-time waveforms and historical trend data on the display screen. The system should transmit critical alerts to the central nursing station immediately. The device must perform self-diagnostics on startup and alert users to any hardware failures. All sensor data shall be timestamped with millisecond precision for accurate analysis. The software must comply with IEC 62304 medical device software lifecycle standards. Battery backup should maintain device operation for minimum 2 hours during power outages. The system shall maintain data integrity during software updates and device restarts.
