The Electronic Health Records system must authenticate healthcare providers using multi-factor authentication before granting access to patient data. The system shall encrypt all patient information both in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption standards. Healthcare providers should be able to search patient records by name, date of birth, or medical record number within 2 seconds. The application must maintain an audit trail of all user activities including login attempts, data access, and modifications. Users shall only access patient information relevant to their assigned patients and role-based permissions. The system should automatically log out inactive users after 15 minutes of inactivity. Medical staff must be able to update patient vital signs, medications, and treatment notes in real-time. The EHR system shall integrate with laboratory systems to automatically import test results. All patient data must be backed up daily and stored in geographically separate locations. The system should generate compliance reports for HIPAA audits on demand.
